Ultra-realistic half-length vertical portrait of Eva Aurea, a youthful, elegant, and slender woman inspired by the grandeur of the ancient world, appearing around 22 years old. She has long, flowing white hair with subtle golden highlights, slightly wavy, framing her face and cascading over her shoulders. Her skin is fair with a soft golden undertone, her eyes are bright and confident, and her lips form a subtle, warm smile, radiating intelligence, serene authority, and charisma. She wears a sleeveless ancient Greek-style white chiton with fine golden trim, visible from the shoulders to just below the waist, cinched with a thin gold cord. The fabric is light, natural, and softly draped with delicate folds. In her right hand, she gently holds a rolled parchment scroll tied with a thin cord, as if about to share ancient wisdom. She wears no modern elements â€” only a simple golden arm cuff and a thin circlet crown, symbolizing power without excess. The background is softly lit marble with hints of tall Corinthian columns, warm sunlight streaming through, casting gentle shadows. Cinematic lighting, ultra-sharp detail, photorealistic, timeless atmosphere, vertical composition, no modern objects, no fantasy armor, no excessive embellishment.
